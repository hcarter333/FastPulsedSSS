\begin{abstract}
We present an updated version of DeSilva's can crusher simulator, first used in 1994.  The original simulator has been updated from IDL to Python that runs in the SageMath framework.  The project has been open-sourced.  The code has alos been re-written in an object oriented architecture that allows for simple input of solenoid parameters.  This allows multiple solenoids with varying design envelopes to be simulated and compared.  We presesnt a brief note on the faciliteis the simulator now provids, and the basics of its use.  The simulator still serves perhaps most usefully in conjunction with a can crusher apparatus in an undergraduate laboratory setting.  In addition to the above, the code clearly points out the chain rule of differentiation and how it applies to dynamic experimetnal situations.

Problems in special relativity are often met with trepidation by undergraduate and graduate physics students.  The solutions seem to have little resemblance to their classical counterparts when taken at face value, and students can be left with the feeling that they are relearning mechanics.  Problems that involve acceleration such as rocket propulsion and the twin paradox present even larger obstacles due to confusion about how to treat acceleration in the framework of special relativity.  While the simple one dimensional derivation of rocket velocity with respect to propellant mass appears in many undergraduate texts, its relativistic counterpart seldom does.  The twin paradox, resolved by taking into account that one of the twins is accelerating while the other is not, is ripe for misinterpretation as pointed out by Gruber \cite{gruberi}. These misinterpretations and general confusion about acceleration and the twin paradox led to the following amusing quote from Schild\cite{schildi}:

\begin{quote}
``A good many physicists believe that this paradox can only be resolved by the general theory of relativity.  They find great comfort in this, because they don't know any general relativity and feel that they don't have to worry about the problem until they decide to learn general relativity."
\end{quote}

We will show that the simple expression for rapidity can be utilized as a mathematical transform between the solution space of classical mechanics and that of special relativity.  This transform not only makes light work of the problems mentioned above, but it also places the student back in familiar territory by illustrating the relationship between familiar non-relativistic mechanics solutions and their special relativistic counterparts.   

The derivation of the transform requires a few definitions.  The rapidity of a particle moving with velocity   along the x â€“axis of the laboratory frame can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\label{rapidity}
\frac{v}{c} = tanh\left(\frac{w}{c}\right).
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light.  In most texts, the rapidity is denoted simply as $w$ rather than $w/c$.  We have chosen to scale the rapidity by $1/c$ to simplify our further derivations.  Karapetoff, who wrote one of the most extensive treatments of rapidity\cite{karapetoffi} also noted that 
\begin{equation}
\label{gamma}
\gamma=\frac{dt}{d\tau} = cosh\left(\frac{w}{c}\right).
\end{equation}
where $t$ denotes laboratory frame time, and $\tau$ denotes proper time.  

The final expression we require relates an infinitesimal change in velocity, $dv$, as measured in the laboratory frame to an infinitesimal increment in velocity, $dv'$, as measured between two successive instantaneous reference frames, (IRFs).  Rindler gives this expression\cite{rindlerii} as
\begin{equation}
\label{gsquared}
dv=\gamma^{-2}\left(v\right)dv'.
\end{equation}
The expression can be derived by first expressing $dv$ as acceleration times an incremental step in time, then Lorentz transforming the product to the moving frame to give
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{gsquaredderiv}
dv& = &\left(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\right)dt = \left(\frac{\left(1/\gamma\right)d^2x'}{\left(\gamma^2\right)d\tau^2}\right)\left(\gamma\right)d\tau = \gamma^{-2}dv'.
\end{eqnarray}

It will now be shown that $w$, the rapidity, defined above in equation (\ref{rapidity}), corresponds to the velocity defined by linearly accumulating the infinitesimal changes in the IRF velocity, $dv'$.  This accumulated non-relativistic velocity  is the same velocity that would be measured by an observer moving with the particle using an accelerometer in conjunction with a stopwatch.   By referencing the accelerometer at each tick of the clock, the co-moving observer can calculate $v'$ as a function of proper time:
\begin{equation}
\label{accint}
v'\left(\tau\right)=\int_0^{\tau} \! a\left(\tau'\right)d\tau'+v'\left(0\right),
\end{equation}
where $a\left(\tau\right)$ is the proper acceleration, and $v'\left(0\right)$ is the object's initial velocity.  We have chosen v'(0) to be zero with no loss of generality as we shall see.  Using equations (\ref{rapidity}), (\ref{gsquared}), and (\ref{accint}), it can be shown that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dv}{dv'}=\gamma^{-2}\left(v\right)=\frac{1}{cosh^2\left(\frac{w}{c}\right)}=\frac{dv}{dw},
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation}
\label{rapnonrel}
dw=dv'
\end{equation}

In other words, the oft-mentioned, but rarely expanded-upon rapidity is simply a scaled version of the, (generally time-dependent), non-relativistic velocity $v'$ with respect to the laboratory frame!

Equation (\ref{rapnonrel}) can be integrated to give
\begin{equation}
\label{rapinit}
w=v'+w\left(0\right)
\end{equation}
where $w\left(0\right)$ is an initial rapidity that is related to the moving particle's initial laboratory frame velocity by 
\begin{equation}
\label{raptanh}
\frac{w\left(0\right)}{c}=tanh^{-1}\left(\frac{v\left(0\right)}{c}\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Examples}

With our new-found interpretation of rapidity in hand, let's try a few examples.  Our first example provides a simple derivation of the hyperbolic equations of motion for a uniformly accelerated particle and also illuminates another important aspect of rapidity that follows from the derivation shown above.  In Rindler's original derivation of hyperbolic motion\cite{rinlderi} he calculated the distance traveled by a rocket in the laboratory frame with respect to the travel time as perceived by the passengers of the rocket, this is known as the proper velocity and is denoted by  $dx/d\tau$.  We will re-derive Rindler's expression for proper velocity using the rapidity transform shown above.  The non-relativistic expression for the velocity of a particle starting from rest at the origin and moving with constant acceleration $\alpha$ with respect to the rest frame of the particle is
\begin{equation}
\label{rindtransformI}
v'=\alpha\tau=w.
\end{equation}
Inserting this into our transform gives
\begin{equation}
\label{transform1}
\frac{v}{c} = tanh\left(\frac{v'}{c}\right)=tanh\left(\frac{\alpha \tau}{c}\right).
\end{equation}
This can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{rapidityexp}
\frac{1}{c}\frac{dx}{dt} = tanh\left(\frac{\alpha \tau}{c}\right)=\frac{sinh\left(\frac{\alpha \tau}{c}\right)}{cosh\left(\frac{\alpha \tau}{c}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Multiplying both sides by the hyperbolic cosine in the denominator and using the substitution defined by (\ref{gamma}) we get 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c}\frac{dx}{dt}cosh\left(\frac{\alpha \tau}{c}\right) = \frac{1}{c}\frac{dx}{dt}\frac{dt}{d\tau}=\frac{1}{c}\frac{dx}{d\tau}= sinh\left(\frac{\alpha \tau}{c}\right),
\end{equation}
the desired expression for $dx/d\tau$.  To get the distance traveled with respect to $\tau$ we integrate to get
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{c^2}{\alpha}cosh\left(\frac{\alpha\tau}{c}\right)-\frac{c^2}{\alpha},
\end{equation}
which is identical to Rindler's result\cite{rinlderi}.  A similar derivation can be performed to arrive at
\begin{equation}
t =\frac{c}{\alpha}sinh\left(\frac{\alpha\tau}{c}\right)
\end{equation}
which can be used to explore the twin paradox.

The following pair of equations can be obtained easily from (\ref{rapidityexp}) 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dx}{d\tau} & = & c\ sinh\left(\frac{v'\left(\tau\right)}{c}\right) \nonumber \\
\frac{d\left(ct\right)}{d\tau} & = & c\ cosh\left(\frac{v'\left(\tau\right)}{c}\right).
\end{eqnarray}
These two equations demonstrate that classical velocities can be projected (see Figure~\ref{sunsets}) directly onto the two-dimensional Minkowski space-time axes representing the object's â€˜proper speedsâ€™ through laboratory space and time respectively.  The object's proper speed with respect to space is the distance traveled in the laboratory frame with respect to the object's proper time, as defined by Brehme\cite{brehmefour}.  The object's proper speed through laboratory time is $dt/d\tau=\gamma$.

\end{figure}

For a complete treatment of proper velocity, we refer the reader to Robert Flynn's excellent primer on spacecraft navigation\cite{flynn}.  Note that it can immediately be seen that as the object's proper speed increases, the rate of progression of laboratory time with respect to proper time also increases due to time dilation.  In other words, as the object's relative speed through laboratory space increases, its relative speed through laboratory time decreases as pointed out by Brehme\cite{brehmegeo} and popularized by Greene\cite{greene}.

In the introduction, reference was made to the relativistic rocket propulsion problem.  Goldstein, in his graduate mechanics text\cite{goldsteini}, begins his version of the problem by noting that ``The theory of rocket motion developed in Exercise 3, Chapter 1, no longer applies in the relativistic region, in part because there is no longer conservation of mass."  He then asks the student to show that a different differential equation holds in the relativistic regime,
\begin{equation}
m\frac{dv}{dm}+a\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)=0,
\end{equation}
and to show that the solution to this new equation can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{c}=\frac{\left(1-\frac{m}{m_o}\right)^{\frac{2a}{c}}}{\left(1+\frac{m}{m_o}\right)^{\frac{2a}{c}}}
\end{equation}

Using the transformation method illustrated here, no new differential equation is necessary.  We simply transform the solution of the non-relativistic rocket problem for a rocket starting from rest, 
\begin{equation}
v=a\ ln\left(\frac{m_o}{m_f}\right)
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the exhaust velocity of the propellant with respect to the rocket,   $m_o$ is the initial mass of the rocket and $m_f$ is the final mass of the rocket.  The transform yields 
\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{c}=tanh\left(\frac{a}{c} ln\left(\frac{m_o}{m_f}\right)\right).
\end{equation}
Keeping in mind that the hyperbolic tangent can be written as
\begin{equation}
tanh\left(u\right)=\frac{e^u-e^{-u}}{e^u+e^{-u}},
\end{equation}
a short bit of algebra shows
\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{c}=\frac{\left(1-\frac{m_f}{m_o}\right)^{\frac{2a}{c}}}{\left(1+\frac{m_f}{m_o}\right)^{\frac{2a}{c}}},
\end{equation}
as indicated by Goldstein.

\section{Conclusion}

We've shown that the unassuming expression for rapidity can be used to transform solutions of kinematical problems from non-relativistic mechanics directly to their relativistic counterparts.  In addition to making easy work of relativistic mechanics, the method serves as a useful pedagogical tool, demonstrating that relativistic solutions can be seen as a direct consequence of their classical progenitors.  By separating the rapidity expression into its hyperbolic sine and cosine terms, it was shown that classical velocities can be projected directly onto their proper velocity counterparts.  This projection serves to further establish an intuitive relationship between classical and relativistic mechanics and also provides an effective springboard for discussions of the hyperbolic geometric nature of Minkowski space-time.
