The following steps detail how to install and use the simulator.
\\
1.  Download the latest simulator release file crushersim.sage from \url{https://github.com/hcarter333/cancrusher} .  Also download one of the example simulations such as sim\_no\_sc\_42\_5000.sage
\\
2.  Create an account for yourself at \url{https://cloud.sagemath.com} .  Create a new project and upload both of the files from step 1 into the project.
\\
3.  Open the newly created project file sim\_no\_sc\_42\_5000.sage .  Click in the first cell, and then click on the 'Run' button in the upper left-hand corner of the interface.  After a short runtime, (on the order of thirty seconds depending on cloud load), you should see simulator results similar to the figures in this article.
\\
4.  Using the Wiki documentation available at the github repository, \url{https://github.com/hcarter333/cancrusher/wiki}, customize the simulator as you please, and re-run.
